# High fidelity parameterised geometry in GEANT4 described by data
GEANT4 provides a number of techniques for representing replica or similar repeating geometryCachedParameterisation aims to provide functionality for loading geometry described by data, where the memory requirement for the parameterisation itself as well as the data is larger than the available system memory.
